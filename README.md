# Mourad Ouachani

**Principal Specialist Solution Architect - AI & Data** at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com)

I help organizations adopt and operationalize AI/ML solutions on OpenShift AI. My focus areas include MLOps, Agentic AI, RAG systems, model serving at scale, and edge AI. I design and build reference architectures, demos, and enablement content to accelerate adoption of Red Hat's AI & Data portfolio.
